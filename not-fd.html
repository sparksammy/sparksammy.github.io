<h1>Not F'd - Sparksammy.com</h1>
<p><i>"Facebook, in it self, is not secure. Just like Windows 10 it 
collects more personal data than one could even imagine. In fact, barely
 anyone cares, because they think it is important to their lifes and 
socialness. I disagree. It's basically only useful for logging in to 
websites quicker. Even then, you should use a strong password, and have 
the basic balance of freedom that I put on my homepage. That's why I am 
making my Facebook 'read-only.' Just going to try to minimize my social 
life to 'real-life friends' and social networks that dont collect as 
much as Facebook. Goodbye facebook."<b> --Sparksammy<b></b></b></i></p><b><b>
