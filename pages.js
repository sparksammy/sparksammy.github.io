However, please spell the brand "sparkSammy" as sparkSammy. My skills are programming, eating, sleeping, working with computer-based technology. If you see any silly posts from me on social media, they are probably from a long time ago or it’s someone pretending to be me, so keep that in mind. Most importantly, enjoy my website!

HTMLArray.push(`<h2>Hello, world! Welcome to my blog!</h2> <hr> 10/31/2020 <h3>Hello, world!</h3><br> <p>Hello, my name is Samuel Lord, but you can call me Sparksammy! I worked quite a bit on this site, but now there's a huge banner for WiX. Oh well. It bothers me quite a bit, because I am stuck on the Free plan until I get a TON of cash, but I don't want to pay like 14$/month just to get a website builder. In fact, I prefer my software to be FOSS when it's feasible. Oh well. Good night.

Update: went to sleep at 3:20am. just finished the site. Mostly minor touches between then and now, but a lot of minor touches. Good night.

Update 3 (11/4/2020): This was when my site used WiX, made a few days before this version of the site.`);
