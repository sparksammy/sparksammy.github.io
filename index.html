However, please spell the brand "sparkSammy" as sparkSammy. My skills are programming, eating, sleeping, working with computer-based technology. If you see any silly posts from me on social media, they are probably from a long time ago or itâ€™s someone pretending to be me, so keep that in mind. Most importantly, enjoy my website!

I worked quite a bit on this site, but now there's a huge banner for WiX. Oh well. It bothers me quite a bit, because I am stuck on the Free plan until I get a TON of cash, but I don't want to pay like 14$/month just to get a website builder. In fact, I prefer my software to be FOSS when it's feasible. Oh well. Good night.

<br>
Update: went to sleep at 3:20am. just finished the site. Mostly minor touches between then and now, but a lot of minor touches. Good night.

Update 2: Oops! I forgot to add this. "Find a balance between freedom, comfort, and flexibility; as there is no such thing as full freedom." ~~Samuel (Sparksammy) Lord</p>
Update 3 (11/4/2020): This was when my site used WiX, made a few days before this version of the site.`
