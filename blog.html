</h2><p>Hello, world! I have invented a static blog site generator that's actually user friendly! No more managing themes, this is the only one! (Plain text.) Note that this was originally made for this website, but I decided to make it FOSS under the MIT license so anyone can use it. No more ads, no more databases, no more bullcrud.

</h2><p>Welcome to the future of web design! I like to call this design princible "Compatibility and Function over Design and Form" What exactly does that mean? Well... I want my site to be viewable on browsers as retro-looking as W3M and as modern (and bloated) as propriatary software such as Google's Chrome. (Although I wish you would use FireFox or Chromium. But hey, it's your choice.) Anyways, I hope you enjoy this new site.</p></div><hr/> <!-- an ad between every post --> <iframe data-aa="1401135" src="//acceptable.a-ads.com/1401135" scrolling="no" style="border:0px; padding:0; width:100%; height:20%; overflow:hidden" allowtransparency="true"></iframe><hr/><p>Copyright Samuel Lord - All rights reserved. </p><br><p>Copying and redistribution of this entire page or parts of said page are permitted provided this notice is preserved.</p></body></html>
