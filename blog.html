<h2>A bit of spring cleaning on my site - 5/31/2020</h2>
<p>Welcome to the future of web design! I like to call this design princible "Compatibility and Function over Design and Form" What exactly does that mean? Well... I want my site to be viewable on browsers as retro-looking as W3M and as modern (and bloated) as propriatary software such as Google's Chrome. (Although I wish you would use FireFox or Chromium. But hey, it's your choice.) Anyways, I hope you enjoy this new site.</p>
