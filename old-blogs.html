<p><strong>4/8/19: Jeez I’ve been busy. It’s already been 1 year!</strong></p>

<p>It’s been 1 year without posts. What’s going on? The answer to that is: I am trying to figgure out what to do with my life, play video games, and complete high school. Also: I’ve been working on an even more minimalist site, this time in pure HTML/CSS/JS and without (for the most part) serverside scripting.</p>

Hello, world: An intro post on my blog.
Be yourself; Everyone else is already taken.

— Oscar Wilde.
Hello, I am Samuel Lord, an autistic (not kidding, actually am autistic.) man-child born in 2001. The same year HAL9000 was *supposed* to be made, they made me. My skills? Programming, eating, sleeping, working with computer-based technology. Enjoy my website, I guess. It’s almost my bed time. Goodnight.

No Commentson GEMS seems to work good so far!
Hello! If you haven’t heard yet, me and a friend (well, mostly me) are working on a basic, FOSS Operating System called GEMS. <a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jfI0ts-_WFQ">Here’s</a> a quick demo of some of our progress. (Warning! It’s LOUD)


A demo of GEMS under a QEMU virtual machine in Pop!_OS.
If you would like to help, fork/download the source code, compile it yourself, or just download a pre-built release, you can go to my GitHub (in the footer) and go to my GEMS repo.

Besides that, have fun!

–Sparksammy

Why I decided to destroy TVI and end my “friendship” with FlyingDuck3121 /DSchott1234

No Comments on Why I decided to destroy TVI and end my “friendship” with FlyingDuck3121 /DSchott1234
Because:

DS was a bad friend and kept on censoring me multiple times for no reason, even though it wasn’t even that bad.
We both know I am American, thus have freedom of speech
Would censor me even if I said something like “TVI is getting boring, here’s why…” with very justifiable reasoning
TVI was the most boring, most strict group I’ve ever been to.
They are a bunch of boring nerds.
Their group activities are boring as well.
They are strict AF.
TVI is just overall not fun, it has lost it’s magic.
Anyone who says otherwise hasn’t been to TVI in the early days. (Back when things weren’t as strict
To give them a message they cannot ignore.
And that’s why I destroyed TVI and ended my “friendship” with the owner. I tried talking with him the time before last (i.e. before when everyone was like “FU YOU ARE LYING” or “ZOMG SPARKSAMMY.COM IS DANGEROUS” even though I wasn’t/it isn’t.), but no resolution was ever formed.

No Commentson How to get a setup like mine (as of May 1st 2020)
What you need:

A Pop!_OS laptop with internet and Parsec client logged in

A Windows PC with internet Parsec server logged in (same app as the client, hosting is just a Windows-only feature as of the writing of this post)

1 HDMI cable (2 if you have an NVIDIA card and want to hook the Laptop to a display, if you don’t have an extra HDMI cable you can just use the display of the laptop)

Unplug everything from the Windows PC except HDMI (if you have NVIDIA), Internet, and a spare mouse.
Hook up a keyboard, mouse, headset, etc to your laptop.
Open Parsec
Connect to the same network if you can’t get port forwarding to work
It should automatically find your desktop.
You are done! Click connect on the one with your desktop name once you are ready to use Windows.

No Commentson Sparksammy Web App: The app for all of your Sparksammy cravings!
So. Today Sparksammy decided to make a new web app, it was a web app that listed all of his Blog Posts and the newest youtube video! I think it’s a great idea, I will update you on when it gets released though I doubt it will get into the App Store or Google Play Store cause those are expensive! Especially the App Store. it literally costs 100$ anually to make an app. screw that!

No Commentson How to install ROBLOX/GeForce Now in Linux
Just a quick note before the post: If this looks familiar, that’s because it is. It is highly based off of my old post from my old blog.

WARNING: THIS REQUIRES A BEEFY COMPUTER! ALSO: GENYMOTION IS FOR PERSONAL USE ONLY. DO NOT USE IT FOR BUSINESS. ALSO: THIS IS MEANT FOR POP!_OS…

Download GenyMotion from <a href="https://href.li/?https://www.genymotion.com/fun-zone/" rel="noreferrer">here</a> 
Reboot
Set up GenyMotion and choose the Google Pixel 3 on Android 9
Install Android Oreo ARM Package shown <a href="https://href.li/?https://pentester.land/tips-n-tricks/2018/10/19/installing-arm-android-apps-on-genymotion-devices.html" rel="noreferrer">here</a> (Drag and drop)
Reboot VIRTUAL DEVICE
Install GAPPS (Click the button to the right, near the top of the window, marked OpenGApps)
Reboot VIRTUAL DEVICE
  Download the latest ROBLOX apk <a href="https://apps.evozi.com/apk-downloader/?id=com.roblox.client">here</a> and/or GeForce Now from <a href="https://www.apkmirror.com/apk/nvidia/nvidia-geforce-now">here.</a>
Install (Drag and drop)
Once you have done all those steps, it should work!
Disclaimer: You might have to do a ton of captchas!
How to: Add a USB controller
Ok so basically you have to add yourself to the group “vboxusers” by running:

1
sudo usermod -a -G vboxusers $USER
and rebooting. Then download the VirtualBox Extensions Pack and install it. Lastly, go to your Virtual Machine Settings for your device (should be the name of your Genymotion instance), then go to USB, change it to USB 2.0, and add your USB controller (Mine was called “GAME For Windows” because mine was a bootleg XBOX 360 Controller made for Windows.) Apply changes, click OK, BUT DO NOT START IT FROM VIRTUALBOX. Instead, close VirtualBox, and start it from GenyMotion. Ta-da! It should now work!
